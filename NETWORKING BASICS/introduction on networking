1 introduction for networking by google.
2 two types of networking models available.
	1.TCD/IP
	2.OSI 
3 we see about TCD/IP.
	the tcd/ip model consist of five layers

		sl.no  	layer   -   protocol    -    protocol data unit    -    addressing
		1	physical   10baseT,802.11	bits			n/a
		2	datalink   ethernet,wifi	frames			MAC Address
		3	network	   IP			datagram		IP address
		4	transport  TCP/UDP		segment			port #'s
		5	appl~ion   HTTP,SMTP,etc..	messeges 		n/a

4 these layers are used for transfering data through one or more computers on a network.
5 physical layer is through the cable  these cables are under two catagories normal and duplex cables or twisted cables.
6 hub are used to connect two computers lan cable {local area network} these hub are used to send data through it on a various connection of a lan network but only one computer can transfer data at a time.
7 switches are used to reduce the limitations of the hub, this switchs are used to connect a set of computers in a lan and can be link.
transmitting data at a same time.
8 routers are used to data transmission through one part of world to another computer through internet.
9 these datas are transfered through this TCP/UDP
10 TCP transport protocols this reduces the collision of data in a network when n no of data was transfered through the same network.
11 udp is the basic of tcp these have limitations over tcp.
12 routers operates in layer 3 network layer.
13 duplex means communication on both sides.i.e the sender and reciver can both send and recive data.
14 networking is a bits that represents in 8 numbers [octet].
